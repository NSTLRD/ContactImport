# ContactImport
hello in this exercise I made a pagination list for contact which you can export the list to pdf and excel.

the requirement asked cvs but I couldn't fulfill it.

I couldn't do unit tests for time, but I implemented admin and user roles so that the user can upload new employees and the admin can download that list of employees to pdf or excel formats.
use spring mvc and spring security. for the backend, also use boostrap for the front end.
